With the expansion of the World Wide Web, a huge amount of data is being available for users. As a result, the need for data mining techniques has increased in order to organize this large amount of data making it accessible for the users. In this project, we are predicting the next web page that will be visited by the user in a particular website based on the data which has the sequence of page visits of many users to that website previously. We performed analysis on the preprocessed data and to predict the result. Here we have clearly explained how the data is preprocessed and how the frequent patterns are mined, and how this patterns are used to predict the next page.

Implementation
	1 Mining Frequent Sequences
	2 Generating Association Rules
	3 Construction of Probability matrix 
	4 Prediction
This project is similar to a master basket analysis but uses SPADE sequence mining algoritham proposed by MOHAMMED J. ZAKI
